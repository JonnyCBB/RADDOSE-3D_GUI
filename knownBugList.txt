######### RADDOSE-3D GUI KNOWN BUG LIST  ###########
####################################################

Add any spotted bugs as they are found upon GUI testing:

-'Bad window path name' warning appears whenever hovering text boxes are
generated by moving cursor over input label text. Need to get to the bottom of
this at some point

- Beam name is not given in the summary window when an experiment is run. Also
 the formatting can be improved too.

- If no beams or crystals have been selected from the lists and you click the
"View" button, it doesn't return any message to the User. Need to fix this!

- Allows you to try to run RADDOSE-3D even when a crystal object hasn't been
loaded into the "Choose a crystal" frame

- RADDOSE-3D runs but fails to display the summary in the summary output window.
Something to do with the container stuff. Below is the output of the failed run.
