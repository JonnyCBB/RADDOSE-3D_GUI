######### RADDOSE-3D GUI KNOWN BUG LIST  ###########
####################################################

Add any spotted bugs as they are found upon GUI testing:

- RADDOSE-3D doesn't tell the user if it completely fails to run. If the only
input is a crystal object (no beam or wedge parameters specified) then pressing
the run button still works.

- RADDOSE-3D pre-made input files no longer can be run independently without manually
loading crystal and beam content from them - need to be incorporated within the new
strategy summary window (probably after this is completed...)

- Can't currently pass the experiment dictionaries to the secondary bar plot window as
objects. Subsequently, can't currently pass dose values of loaded experiments to include
within barplot.
