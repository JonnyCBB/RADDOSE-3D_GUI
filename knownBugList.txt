######### RADDOSE-3D GUI KNOWN BUG LIST  ###########
####################################################

Add any spotted bugs as they are found upon GUI testing:

- RADDOSE-3D doesn't tell the user if it completely fails to run. If the only
input is a crystal object (no beam or wedge parameters specified) then pressing
the run button still works.

- If the same pre-made input file is loaded twice then the crystals and beams
with the same names are loaded twice. We may want this but I thought it would be
good to dicuss

- Beam parsers currently search for pixelsize and FWHM values irrespective of beam type.
This means that any added beams must have all properties specified regardless of beam type, 
or parsers will crash

- If pre-made RD3D file read for full experiment, or just to input beam parameters, the
PixelSize property must be present, otherwise this causes a crash within the clickBeamAdd method,
where it is assumed to habe been read in..
