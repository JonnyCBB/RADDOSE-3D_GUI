######### RADDOSE-3D GUI KNOWN BUG LIST  ###########
####################################################

Add any spotted bugs as they are found upon GUI testing:

-'Bad window path name' warning appears whenever hovering text boxes are
generated by moving cursor over input label text. Need to get to the bottom of
this at some point

- Beam name is not given in the summary window when an experiment is run. Also
 the formatting can be improved too.

- If no beams or crystals have been selected from the lists and you click the
"View" button, it doesn't return any message to the User. Need to fix this!

- Allows you to try to run RADDOSE-3D even when a crystal object hasn't been
loaded into the "Choose a crystal" frame

- currently if faulty premade RD3D input file run - RD3D will crash and then crystal/beam
objects will try to be made - any suitable objects (after checks performed) will be added to
interface, whereas the faulty objects will not be included -- not really a bug, but do we want
this? Or should a bad RD3D run just kill the method before any objects are made?

- I have the command line error:

InputException: Parser found 1 error in input:
RADDOSE-3D-input.txt line 8:0 extraneous input 'SolventFraction' expecting FLOAT
Unhandled input exception InputException: Parser found 1 errors in input:
RADDOSE-3D-input.txt line 8:0 extraneous input 'SolventFraction' expecting FLOAT

Is this a GUI error or a RD3D input file error? I can't tell..

RD3D output log says: Solvent fraction determined as NaN%.
RD3D input file has: SolventFraction 0.5
