######### RADDOSE-3D GUI KNOWN BUG LIST  ###########
####################################################

Add any spotted bugs as they are found upon GUI testing:

- RADDOSE-3D doesn't tell the user if it completely fails to run. If the only
input is a crystal object (no beam or wedge parameters specified) then pressing
the run button still works.

-Experiment lists aren't correctly deleted (need to investigate this further).

-Summaries aren't correctly displayed when choosing to select summaries for an
experiment when multiple experiments are loaded.

- RADDOSE-3D pre-made input files no longer can be run independently without manually 
loading crystal and beam content from them - need to be incorporated within the new
strategy summary window (probably after this is completed...)
