########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before release (Aim for August 1st)
-***************************-

- Checks for inputs in a pre-made RADDOSE-3D file (CSB)

- Need to add a check when experiments are run to see if any files are already
in use by other programs.(JBB)

- Create user guide (JBB + CSB LATER)

- check cross platform image functionality (pkg PIL runs into problems on anaconda
python 2.7.9 on mac). Need to test on ubuntu also... Try dials.python and logging into DLS (JBB)

- Make sure that the default values for any inputs that are optional but left
null are the same as those specified in the RADDOSE-3D user manual. (JBB)

- Make sure that the GUI reads integers as well as floats for fields that
require floating point values. (CSB)

- Add additional crystal/beam class checks (CSB)

- Add warnings as well as the current checks for crystals/beam classes (CSB)

- Do the parsers handle container information correctly when reading from premade RD3D
input files and creating crystal objects? Need to check this! (CSB)

- Sort out GUI so it adjusts to the correct size for the screen that it's being
displayed on. Also work out how to scale summary text box with screen & frame sizes (JBB)

- Add experimental beam image file converter code (JBB)

- Currently user can only load in input file if they want to run an experiment.
However they may also have other files that need to be loaded (e.g. model
geometry file or experimental beam file). We need to work out a way that the
RADDOSE-3D GUI can read these when necessary to run RADDOSE-3D. (JBB)

- If the same pre-made input file is loaded twice then the crystals and beams
with the same names are loaded twice. - want to be able to have same crystal loaded
twice, but names MUST be different & have a warning if an identical crystal has been
loaded (JBB)

-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)

- Mixture list should appear in alphabetical order

- Sort out the resolution problem: What voxel resolution is required for
 sufficient convergence?

 - Sort out optimisation problem: What offset to pick to get max DDE?

 - Visualisation of the experiment so user can see what is going on.

 - change %s syntax to .format() throughout for consistency

- sort out how container info passed to crystal class - is a dictionary really
the easiest way?

- Need to complete help.py class (the interactive help box). This will be best
once all the other input sections are completed

- When user types incompatible data format into a field and clicks 'make', the
input window moves to the back of the screen. We should try to find out how to
keep it at the front of the screen.
