########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before 30th June 2015
-***************************-

- Need an option to look for RADDOSE-3D input files and create an "experiment"
from the input file.

- Need to be able to "load" multiple experiments so that the doses can be
compared. Make experiment objects.
crystal
beam
wedge
time stamp
dose

- Need to be able to delete experiment objects as well as the directory

- Make bar plot to compare experiments

- Need to output a summary of the main results from an experiment run.

- Need to add buttons on for the summary window so the user can switch between
plots, experiment summaries, input information etc.


-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Crystal and beam options need to check for sensible inputs.
(i.e. numerical values are given for crystal dimensions)

- to continue the previous point, drop down boxes of RADDOSE-3D inputs should be
made for inputs that can only take certain values or text.

- Fix the scroll bars (they don't always seem to work)

- Add more options to Help/Suggestion Dialogue

- Add capability to create an interactive dose contour plot (with axis)

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)

- Add more RADDOSE-3D input options (inc PDB)

- Split guiRUN.py into smaller scripts to make it more managable
