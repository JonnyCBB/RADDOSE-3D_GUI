########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before release (Aim for August 1st)
-***************************-

- Checks for inputs in a pre-made RADDOSE-3D file (CSB) - Mostly finished

- Need to add a check when experiments are run to see if any files are already
in use by other programs.(JBB)

- Create user guide (JBB + CSB LATER)

- Check GUI works on Windows, Linux (diamond UNIX distribution mainly) and Mac.
(JBB (Win + Linux) + CSB (Mac) LATER - once it's complete)

- Add warnings as well as the current checks for crystals/beam classes (CSB)

- Add experimental beam image file converter code (JBB)

- Currently user can only load in input file if they want to run an experiment.
However they may also have other files that need to be loaded (e.g. model
geometry file or experimental beam file). We need to work out a way that the
RADDOSE-3D GUI can read these when necessary to run RADDOSE-3D. (JBB)

- Add file finders for inputs that require paths to files (JBB)

- If the same pre-made input file is loaded twice then the crystals and beams
with the same names are loaded twice. - want to be able to have same crystal loaded
twice, but names MUST be different & have a warning if an identical crystal has been
loaded (CSB) - Mostly finished

-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Currently experimental beam type collimation inputs from beam maker window are not
passed to beam objects and are lost. Should these be passed through, even though RD3D
does not need them? Leave them for now. I need to check that RADDOSE-3D doesn't
do anything to the experimental beam image if collimation is set. Shouldn't be a
problem yet since at diamond the image is taken after the slits and hence the
image should already be collimated, hence why this isn't immediate.

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)

- Mixture list should appear in alphabetical order

- Sort out the resolution problem: What voxel resolution is required for
 sufficient convergence?

 - Sort out optimisation problem: What offset to pick to get max DDE?

 - Visualisation of the experiment so user can see what is going on.

 - change %s syntax to .format() throughout for consistency

- sort out how container info passed to crystal class - is a dictionary really
the easiest way?

- Need to complete help.py class (the interactive help box). This will be best
once all the other input sections are completed

- When user types incompatible data format into a field and clicks 'make', the
input window moves to the back of the screen. We should try to find out how to
keep it at the front of the screen.
