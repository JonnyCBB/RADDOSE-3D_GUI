########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before release (Aim for August 1st)
-***************************-

- Add more RADDOSE-3D input options for the manual input.

- add functionaility to save summary of compared experiments currently loaded within
summary window - Do we want CSV format for output?

- change %s syntax to .format() throughout for consistency

- Checks for inputs in a pre-made RADDOSE-3D file

- Need to add a check when experiments are run to see if any files are already
in use by other programs.

- Fix the scroll bars (they don't always seem to work)

- Create user guide

- Add more options to Help/Suggestion Dialogue

- check cross platform image functionality (pkg PIL runs into problems on anaconda
python 2.7.9 on mac). Need to test on ubuntu also...

- When users change option in drop down list in crystalMaker/BeamMaketr/StrategyMaker windows
they should retain the values in the fields that they have already entered in as
opposed to setting the values to some default (often .set("0"))

-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- If you don't put valid inputs in for the crystal and you try to make a crystal
it wont let you make that crystal but the crystal maker window closes and you
lose the inputs that you did have. This needs to be changed so that the window
doesn't close and you keep the inputs that you did have.

- Add help buttons for each of the RADDDOSE-3D inputs

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)
