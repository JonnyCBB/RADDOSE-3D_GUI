########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before 30th June 2015
-***************************-

- Need to add a "View Log" button so user can see the log file in the summary
window.

- Add properties to the experiment class that include more summary information
these include:
Used Volume
Elastic Yield
Diffraction Efficiency
Dose Inefficiency



-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Crystal and beam options need to check for sensible inputs.
(i.e. numerical values are given for crystal dimensions)

- to continue the previous point, drop down boxes of RADDOSE-3D inputs should be
made for inputs that can only take certain values or text.

- Fix the scroll bars (they don't always seem to work)

- Add more options to Help/Suggestion Dialogue

- Add capability to create an interactive dose contour plot (with axis)

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)

- Add more RADDOSE-3D input options (inc PDB)

- Split guiRUN.py into smaller scripts to make it more managable

- Checks for inputs in a pre-made RADDOSE-3D file

- Add check to see if user have seaborn installed. If so then we can do pretty
plots
