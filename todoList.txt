########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before 30th June 2015
-***************************-

- Need an option to look for RADDOSE-3D input files and create an "experiment"
from the input file.

- Need to be able to "load" multiple experiments so that the doses can be
compared.

- Need to decide on a plot (scatter plot) to compare dose against experiment,
and implement it.

- Need to output a summary of the main results from an experiment run.



-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Crystal and beam options need to check for sensible inputs.
(i.e. numerical values are given for crystal dimensions)

- to continue the previous point, drop down boxes of RADDOSE-3D inputs should be
made for inputs that can only take certain values or text.

- Fix the scroll bars (they don't always seem to work)

- Add more options to Help/Suggestion Dialogue

- Need to add buttons on for the summary window so the user can switch between
plots, experiment summaries, input information etc.

- Add capability to create an interactive dose contour plot (with axis)
