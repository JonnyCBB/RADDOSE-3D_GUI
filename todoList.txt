########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before release (Aim for August 1st)
-***************************-

- add functionaility to save summary of compared experiments currently loaded within
summary window - Do we want CSV format for output?

- change %s syntax to .format() throughout for consistency

- Checks for inputs in a pre-made RADDOSE-3D file

- Need to add a check when experiments are run to see if any files are already
in use by other programs.

- Fix the scroll bars (they don't always seem to work)

- Create user guide

- check cross platform image functionality (pkg PIL runs into problems on anaconda
python 2.7.9 on mac). Need to test on ubuntu also...

- When users change option in drop down list in crystalMaker/BeamMaketr/StrategyMaker windows
they should retain the values in the fields that they have already entered in as
opposed to setting the values to some default (often .set("0"))

- Add units to the crystal input labels

- Increase width of the "File" field in the Beam Maker window when the
"Experimental" beam type is selected.

- Make sure that the default values for any inputs that are optional but left
null are the same as those specified in the RADDOSE-3D user manual.

- Make sure that the GUI reads integers as well as floats for fields that
require floating point values.

- If you don't put valid inputs in for the crystal and you try to make a crystal
it wont let you make that crystal but the crystal maker window closes and you
lose the inputs that you did have. This needs to be changed so that the window
doesn't close and you keep the inputs that you did have so you don't have to
input everything again.

-include RADDOSE FORTRAN executable so that users can run RADDOSE V2.

-Some of the help text isn't formatted properly (there are hidden characters
which don't show up in the editor but appear in the GUI). Need to get rid of
these. - Jonny do you mean in the help summary box or the hovering boxes? I mean
in the hovering boxes. I copy pasted some of the text from a pdf file and there
are hidden characters showing up!

-Need to complete help.py class (the interactive help box). This will be best
once all the other input sections are completed

-In guiRun.py, when a beam is loaded from a premade RD3D input file, it is created
using the 'beams' class - this needs to be updated to instead use beams subclasses,
dependent on which beam type is present

- Similarly to above, when a crystal is loaded from a premade RD3D input file, need
to ensure correct crystal subclasses are used when creating new crystal objects

- Do the parsers handle container information correctly when reading from premade RD3D
input files and creating crystal objects? Need to check this!

- Sort out GUI so it adjusts to the correct size for the screen that it's being
displayed on.

- Perhaps change font of summary window output to see if that fixes the
formatting issue

- change location of dose contour button within main interface

-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)

- Mixture list should appear in alphabetical order

- Sort out the resolution problem: What voxel resolution is required for
 sufficient convergence?

 - Sort out optimisation problem: What offset to pick to get max DDE?

 - Visualisation of the experiment so user can see what is going on.
