########### RADDOSE-3D GUI TO DO LIST  #############
####################################################


-***************************-
To do before 30th June 2015
-***************************-


- Add plotting capability for additional experiment summary values (Used Volume,
 Elastic Yield, Diffraction Efficiency, Dose Inefficiency)

- Create new class for pop-up crystal/beam maker windows - make GUI class 
too big currently

- Modify crystal/beam maker windows such that they dynamics change input fields
dependent on crystal/beam type selected

- add functionality to print/save any bar plots created to a suitable working directory

- add functionaility to save summary of compared experiments currently loaded within
summary/output window (csv format?) to a suitable working directory

- change %s syntax to .format() throughout for consistency


-***************************-
To do at some point
-***************************-

- Crystal and beam options need to check for sensible inputs.
(i.e. numerical values are given for crystal dimensions)

- to continue the previous point, drop down boxes of RADDOSE-3D inputs should be
made for inputs that can only take certain values or text.

- Fix the scroll bars (they don't always seem to work)

- Add more options to Help/Suggestion Dialogue

- Add capability to create an interactive dose contour plot (with axis)

- Add toolbar buttons at top of GUI window (e.g. File, View, Save, etc.)

- Add more RADDOSE-3D input options (inc PDB)

- Split guiRUN.py into smaller scripts to make it more managable

- Checks for inputs in a pre-made RADDOSE-3D file

- Add check to see if user have seaborn installed. If so then we can do pretty
plots

- check cross platform image functionality (pkg PIL runs into problems on anaconda 
python 2.7.9 on mac). Need to test on ubuntu also...
